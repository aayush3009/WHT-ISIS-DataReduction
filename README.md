# WHT-ISIS-DataReduction
Simple scripts to reduce WHT ISIS long-slit spectra. The basic reduction is performed using scripts provided by Steve Crawford.

To be done: Add wavelength calibration generalised to the 2D spectrum, add 1D spectrum extraction based on a given aperture and add flux calibration of the 1D extracted spectrum.
